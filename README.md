ExpensesIQ - Personal Budget Tracker

   


ðŸ“± About  

ExpensesIQ is a full-featured personal budget tracker app for Android that was made with Kotlin and Android Studio. It gives customers the ability for analysing their different sources of income, control their daily costs, and establish monthly or category-specific spending limits. The app's clear and easy-to-use design makes it simple to enter income and expenses, and it supports attaching images of receipts for improved recordkeeping. Custom categories can be made and managed by users, who can also give them budgets and get alarms or warnings when they are getting close to their limits.
With its comprehensive data visualisation tools, interactive charts, and deep analyses, ExpensesIQ differentiates itself and assists customers in identifying spending changes, tracking progress over time, and making wise financial decisions. The app also has a dashboard for monitoring daily and monthly expenses, games like badges or awards to promote regular budgeting practices, and safe data storage with RoomDB for durability and offline access.
